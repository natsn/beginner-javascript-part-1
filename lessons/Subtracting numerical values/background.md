Now that we've looked at addition, the next thing to master is subtracting variables.

It works exactly like addition, but instead of the `+` operator, we need to use the `-` operator.

In this example, we subtract two numbers and assign it to a variable called `difference`. Afterwards the variable should have a value of `5`.

####Subtracting
    var difference = 10 - 5;
