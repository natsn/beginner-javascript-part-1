Now that we've defined a function, let's add some arguments to it.
You might recall that arguments are how you pass data to a function, so that it can execute the same logic but on different data.

Let's have a look at passing data to a function. The following piece of code takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`. As you can see, we specify the arguments separated by a comma `,` withing the open brace `(` and closing brace `)`.
