We can also add two strings together with JavaScript, we call this **concatenation**, because.. well, it just sounds cooler.
To do this, we just use the addition `+` operator we used to add numbers together in an earlier exercise.

Here we add `humpty ` and `dumpty ` and `sat on a wall` to give the variable called `egg` a value of `humpty dumpty sat on a wall`.

####String concatenation
    var egg = 'humpty ' + 'dumpty ' + 'sat on a wall';
