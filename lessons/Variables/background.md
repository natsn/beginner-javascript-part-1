To store values so that we can refer to them later on, we use variables. This we do with the `var` keyword. To give the variable a value, we use the `=` operator. Let's have a look at some examples.

Here we declare a new variable called `littlePigs`, and give it a numerical value of `3`.

**Note:** We're ending the statement with a semicolon `;` character. This is how you tell JavaScript that this piece of code should execute as a unit. In JavaScript, you can string a bunch of commands together on the same line, but separated by the semicolon (;) character.

####Number variable assignment
    var littlePigs = 3;

Let's try that with a string variable now.

####String variable assignment

    var firstHouse = 'hay';
