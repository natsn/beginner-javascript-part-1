As with all other languages, it's a common action in JavaScript to calculate values by doing simple arithmetic.

To add two numbers together, we use the `+` operator.

In this example, we add together two numbers assign it to a variable called `sum`. Afterwards the variable should have a value of `2`.

####Summing two items
    var sum = 1 + 1;

In this example, the `sum` variable has a value of `15`.
####Another simple example
    var sum = 7 + 8;

We can also change the value of the variable by adding on to it, because variables in JavaScript are **mutable**. After executing this code, the value of sum is `20`.

####Adding a value to a variable
    var sum = 7 + 8;
    sum = sum + 5;
