We've touched on larger than `>` and smaller than `<` comparison operators, but not equals.
The equals conditional operator `==` is very common, and you will use it a lot.

In this code, the `numberIsFive` variable will have a value of `true`.
####The `==` operator when it's equal
    var number = 5;
    var numberIsFive = number == 5;


In this code, the `numberIsFive` variable will have a value of `false`.
####The `==` operator when it's not equal
    var number = 6;
    var numberIsFive = number == 5;
